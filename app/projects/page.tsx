            In each of my projects, whether they are small or abstract, my
            overall objective remains consistent. Fueled by a profound curiosity
            for engaging technologies such as React Three Fiber and libraries
            like Shadcn, I approach every project with a specific set of
            guidelines. Firstly, I strive to refine and enhance the skills I
            already have. Secondly, I aim to incorporate elements from my direct
            previous project in some capacity, helping to retain and add it to
            my toolkit. Lastly, I introduce and explore new technologies,
            fostering a dynamic and forward-thinking approach in my work.
